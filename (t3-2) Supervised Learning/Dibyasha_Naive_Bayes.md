# Naive_Bayes_Classifier
## Classifier:<br>
A classifier is a machine learning model that is used to discriminate different objects based on certain features.<br>

A Naive Bayes classifier is just a matter of counting how many times each attribute co-occurs with each class. <br>
Naive Bayes is a very popular classification algorithm that is mostly used to get the base accuracy of the dataset.

## Why it is called Naive?<br>
This algorithm makes an assumption as all the variables in the dataset is “Naive” i.e not correlated to each other.

## Principle of Naive Bayes Classifier:<br>
A Naive Bayes classifier is a probabilistic machine learning model that’s used for classification task. The crux of the classifier is based on the Bayes theorem.

## Bayes Theorem:<br>

Using Bayes theorem, we can find the probability of A happening, given that B has occurred. Here, B is the evidence and A is the hypothesis. The assumption 
made here is that the predictors/features are independent. That is presence of one particular feature does not affect the other. Hence it is called naive.
