# Random Forest Algorithm :evergreen_tree: :evergreen_tree:
Random forest is a supervised learning algorithm. It has two variations â€“ one is used for classification problems and other is used for regression problems. 
It is one of the most flexible and easy to use algorithm. It creates decision trees on the given data samples, gets prediction from each tree and selects the 
best solution by means of voting. It is also a pretty good indicator of feature importance.<br>

Random forest algorithm combines multiple decision-trees, resulting in a forest of trees, hence the name Random Forest. In the random forest classifier, the 
higher the number of trees in the forest results in higher accuracy.<br>

Random Forest is the most popular ensemble model for beginner data scientists.

## Ensemble Model :thinking:
An ensemble model is just an ensemble of many models grouped other.

An ensemble model like Random Forest is just a bunch of decision trees. In the below figure there are 3 decision trees.
