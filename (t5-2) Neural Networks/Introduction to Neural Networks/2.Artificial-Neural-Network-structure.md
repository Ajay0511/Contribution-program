# Artificial Neurons

Artificial neuron also known as **perceptron** is the basic unit of the *Artificial neural network*. In simple terms, it is a mathematical function based on a model of *biological neurons*.

# Compare with biological neuron

In the previous blog we had seen the biological neuron structure. Let's compare the artificial neural network with it.

* Dendrites are similar to input to the Perceptron or Node.
* Cell body is similar to Node.
* Axon and Synapse are similar to output from the Node.

The working of artificial neuron is similar to the biological neuron. The node take data from the inputs, process the dataand produce output as per the activation function.

The details of working neuron we will discuss in the later bolgs.

# Artificial Neural Network

The combination of large number of artificial neurons is known as *Perceptrons* to form an Artificial Neural Network(ANN).<br>
A number of nodes combine together to form a Layer.
The layer from which initial data are provided to the neural network is known as Input layer.
The output layer in an artificial neural network is the last layer of neurons that produces given outputs for the program. 
In between input layer and output layer, Hidden layers are present which help in determining the complex features.

ANN is devided into many types, some of them are listed here below:

1. **Feed-Forward Neural Network:**

The feedforward neural network was the first and simplest type of artificial neural network devised. In this network, the information moves in only one direction—forward—from the input nodes, through the hidden nodes (if any) and to the output nodes. There are no cycles or loops in the network.[[wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feedforward_neural_network)
Here each node of one layer connected to all the nodes of adjecent layer.


2. **Convolutional Neural Network:**
