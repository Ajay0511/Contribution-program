Hello Everyone :wave:

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In this blog we will discuss on similarities between biological neural network and artifical neural network and see some of the general sturcture of artificial neural networks.

# Artificial Neurons

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artificial neuron also known as **perceptron** is the basic unit of the *Artificial neural network*. In simple terms, it is a mathematical function based on a model of *biological neurons*.

# Compare with biological neuron

In the previous blog we had seen the biological neuron structure. Let's compare the artificial neural network with it.

* Dendrites are similar to input to the Perceptron or Node.
* Cell body is similar to Node.
* Axon and Synapse are similar to output from the Node.

The working of artificial neuron is similar to the biological neuron. The node take data from the inputs, process the dataand produce output as per the activation function.

The details of working neuron we will discuss in the later bolgs.

# Artificial Neural Network
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The combination of large number of artificial neurons is known as *Perceptrons* to form an Artificial Neural Network(ANN).<br>
A number of nodes combine together to form a Layer.
* The layer from which initial data are provided to the neural network is known as Input layer.
* The output layer in an artificial neural network is the last layer of neurons that produces given outputs for the program. 
* In between input layer and output layer, Hidden layers are present which help in determining the complex features.

The structure of a neural network is designed by the programmer as per the model requirement. The structure is varies from model to model.
Some general sturcture of Neural networks are shown below.

In this blog, we discussed on similarities between biological neural network and artificial neural network and saw different general structure of ANN.
In the next bolg, we will see some types of Artificial neural network.

Thank you :smile:
